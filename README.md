# lottish-translator
for all of those lotties still in school and dont know english (or regular people that dont know lottish)

# Download
Download from the Releases tab

# idk what to call this part
when you open the .exe ignore the command window since its just something that necessary for the code to run

if you want to look at code then download the `lottie translator.py` file and open it in a text editor (idk what im doing so if it doesnt work tell me somehow)
